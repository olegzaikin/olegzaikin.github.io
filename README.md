Computer Science Department, Swansea University, United Kingdom.

I am a Research Assistant at the Computer Science Department of Swansea University.

Previously, I was a leading researcher at Matrosov Institute for System Dynamics and Control Theory, a research institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, working on solving hard cryptographic via SAT.

I did my Ph.D. (candidate of technical sciences in Russia) under the supervision of Alexander A. Semenov at Matrosov Institute for System Dynamics and Control Theory. My thesis was about applying parallel SAT solving to cryptanalysis of stream ciphers.

Currently, my research is mainly focused on the development of new Cube-and-Conquer-based algorithms aimed at solving hard combinatorial problems.
